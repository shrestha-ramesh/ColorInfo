		<p> Red is the color of extremes. It’s the color of passionate love, seduction, violence, danger, anger, and adventure. Our prehistoric ancestors 
			saw red as the color of fire and blood – energy and primal life forces – and most of red’s symbolism today arises from its powerful associations
			in the past.
		</p>
		<p> Red is also a magical and religious color. It symbolized super-human heroism to the Greeks and is the color of the Christian crucifixion. 
			Red was almost as rare and as expensive as purple in ancient days – a fact that may explain its magic and power. Paradoxically, today’s intense 
			red dyes come from crushed insects (the lac beetle and the cochineal).
		</p>
		<p>It is warm color.</p>
