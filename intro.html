		<h1> &quot;About Me&quot; </h1>
		<p> 
			My name is Ramesh Shrestha. At Mark Academy, I took two years worth of social work courses.  
			I worked for different <b>Non-governmental organizations and International non-governmental organizations</b>. 
			Child Workers in Nepal is one of the organization. Now I study at Northeastern Illinois University to get a degree in Computer 
			Science and my concentration is in Information Technology. I am a junior student at this university. I hope I 
			will graduate within a year. I chose this course because this is a Computer Science class and I want to 
			learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In my future career, I want to be a web developer. A company might ask you 
			to build a website or fix a website, you never know, so this is the preparation for that challenge.
		</p>
		<p>
			<q>I love cooking and playing soccer</q>. Usually, I cook food for myself. I like spicy food. My friends also like to play soccer, 
			so we go to Foster beach to play soccer every Sunday. I can ride a bike, play badminton, motorbike, skateboard, play volleyball, tennis, 
			cricket, fish, swim and drive a car. I have worked at different stores in different positions. <br/>&#39;I can speak four languages&#39; but my 
			English is not perfect. So, I am working on it.
