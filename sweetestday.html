					It is good to be home. It’s good to see corn, beans. I was trying to explain to somebody as we were flying in, that’s corn. That’s beans. 
					They were very impressed at my agricultural knowledge. Please give it up for Amari, once again, for that outstanding introduction.
					I have a bunch of good friends here today, including somebody who I served with who is one of the finest senators in the country, and 
					we’re lucky to have your senator, Dick Durbin, is here. I also noticed, by the way, former governor Edgar here, who I haven’t seen in a 
					long time, and somehow he has not aged and it was great to see him. I want to thank everybody at the U of I system for making it possible</i> 
					for me to be here today. I am deeply honored at the Paul Douglas award that is being given to me. He is somebody who set the path for so 
					much outstanding public service here in Illinois. Now, I want to start by addressing the elephant in the room. I know people are still 
					wondering why I didn’t speak at the 2017 commencement. The student body president sent a very thoughtful invitation. Students made a 
					spiffy video, and when I declined, I hear there was speculation that I was boycotting campus until Antonio’s pizza reopened. So I want to 
					be clear. I did not take sides in that late-night food debate.

				<td><sub style="color:lime;">The truth is, after eight years in the white house, I NEEDED TO SPEND SOME TIME ONE ON ONE WITH MICELLE IF I WANTED TO STAY MARRIED. And 
					she says hello, by the way. I also wanted to spend some quality time with my daughters, who were suddenly young women on their way out the 
					door.</sub> And I should add, by the way, now that I have a daughter in college, I can tell all the students here, your parents, they cry 
					privately. It is brutal. So please call. Send a text.<!--Large font size--> <span style="font-size:2em;"> We need to hear from you.</span>Just a little something. Truth was, I was also intent on 
					following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage and making room for new voices and new ideas.
<!--Here text high--><sup style="color:orange;">Truth was, I was also intent on following a wise American tradition of ex-presidents gracefully exiting the political stage and making 
					room for new voices and new ideas. We have our first president, George Washington, to thank for setting that example. After he led the 
					colonies to victory as General Washington, there were no constraints on him, really. He was practically a god to those who had followed 
					him into battle. There was no constitution.</sup>
				</td>												<!--grammar mistake-->																						<!--spelling misake-->				
				<td>Instead, <span style="color:tan">he resigned commander as chief in and moved back to his country estate.</span> Six years later,<span style="color:magenta"> he was elceted prisident.</span> But after two 
					terms, he resigned again and rode off into the sunset. The point Washington made, the point that is essential to American democracy, is 
					that in a government of and by and for the people, there should be no permanent ruling class. There are only citizens, who through their 
					elected and temporary representatives, determine our course and determine our character. I’m here today because this is one of those 
					pivotal moments when every one of us as citizens of the United States need to determine just who it is that we are. Just what it is that 
<!--emphasizes text,usually represented as italics--><em style="color:blue;">we stand for. And as a fellow citizen — not as an ex-president, but as a fellow citizen — I’m here to deliver a simple message, and that
					is that you need to vote because our democracy depends on it. Now, some of you may think I’m exaggerating when I say this November’s 
					elections are more important than any I can remember in my lifetime. I know politicians say that all the time. I have been guilty of 
					saying it a few times, particularly when I was on the ballot. But just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment 
					really is different. The stakes really are higher. The consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire. And it’s not as 
					if we haven’t had big elections before or big choices to make in our history. Fact is, democracy has never been easy, and our founding 
					fathers argued about everything. We waged a civil war. We overcame depression.</em>

					charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.
